<h1>Pilot Briefing</h1>
<h3>Frequency management</h3>
<p>Domestic aircraft should change to the ground or tower frequency automatically. The exception to this is aircraft vacating Runway 16L/34R who should remain on the tower frequency until instructed to change (this will happen on Taxiway Lima.</p>
<p>Arriving aircraft will be transferred to Sydney Director when on downwind or on a 20 mile final. The main frequency will be 126.10 MHz, but in periods of heavier traffic, Director East may be activated to handle Runway 16L/34R arrivals on 125.30 MHz.</p>

<h3>Independent visual approaches</h3>
<p>In visual meteorological conditions (VMC), it is likely that independent visual approaches (IVA) will be conducted to the parallel runways. You will know when IVAs are in use because the ATIS will advise you to "expect independent visual approach" and Sydney Director will be using the phraseology "cleared independent visual approach".</p>
<p>When IVAs are in use, it is important that you report visual (land or water in sight and you are able to maintain visual flight) or runway-in-sight as soon as possible. This will allow controllers to plan separation and spacing accordingly.</p>
<p>If you are cleared for an IVA, you should endeavour to track the runway extended centreline accurately as there may be aircraft on the adjacent centreline who may be on a different Director/Tower frequency.</p>
<h3>Departure clearance</h3>
<p>During periods of heavy departure traffic, airways clearance delivery will be available on 133.80 MHz. Otherwise, you will be able to obtain your clearance from the ground controller responsible for your side of the airport.</p>
<h3>Ground movements</h3>
<p>Clearance is required prior to pushback onto any taxiway. These can be identified on the Aerodrome Chart as any labelled path.</p>
<p>Remember that you MUST <strong>obtain a clearance prior to entering any runway</strong>, including runways that are not listed in the ATIS. Any runway may be used at the discretion of ATC for ad-hoc operations, so make sure that you have received a clearance. If you are unsure, please contact ATC.</p>
<p>When vacating the runway after landing, contact ground and advise them of your preferred parking position. The following image is a guide to the domestic terminal:</p>

<p>The following is a guide to the area of responsibility for each of the aerodrome control positions. Note that certain positions will be merged from time to time.</p>

<h3>Extra fuel for traffic delays</h3>
<p>We don't anticipate that there will be many traffic delays at this year's event, however, a NOTAM will be published 24 hours prior to the event with guidelines. This NOTAM will be made available on this website.</p>
